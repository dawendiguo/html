        Setting an attribute value with jQuery's attr() method is
        really easy, all you hava to do is supply the name of the 
        attribute and a value.
    </p>
    <span class="tmpSetAttr">
        The id attributte of this element is set to <i>tmpSetId</i>.
    </span>
    <p>
        You can also set multiple attributte by supplying an object
        literal to the attr() method.
    </p>
    <span class="tmpSetMultipleAttr">
        The title of this element is set to <i>Hello, world</i>and
        the id attributte of this element is set to <i></i>tmpHellowWorld<i></i>.
    </span>
    <p>
        Getting an attributte value is just as intuitive, all you need
        to do is call the attr() method with the name of the attributte
        you want to get the value for.
    </p>
    <span class="tmpGetAttr" title='Foo'> 
        This element's title attributte has a value of <span></span>
    </span>
    <p>
        An attributte can be removed from an element using the 
        removeAttr() method.
    </p>
    <span class="tmpRemoveAttr">
        This element's class attributte is removed.
    </span>
    <p>
        Element attributte may also be set via a callback function.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>I</li>
        <li>Me</li>
        <li>Mine</li>
    </ul>
