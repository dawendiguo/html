        jQuery's event API is modeled after the standard event API put
        forth by the W3C. It's bind() methord simplefies this API,
        by requiring less code,and dropping a mostly unneeded argument.
    </p>
    <div class="tmpBind">
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
    </div>
    <p>
        jQuery doesn't stop thers, howerver, ou can also use individual
        event methods to bind events.
    </p>
    <div class="tmpIndividual">
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
    </div>
    <p>
        And if that weren't enough, jQuery also provides two methods that
        accommodate applying both a mouseover and mouseout event in the 
        same method, and a method that makes toggling easier and 
        more intuitive.
    </p>
    <div class="tmpPattern">
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
    </div>
    <p>
        You can also programmatically trigger events, like automatically
        focusing the following &lt;textarea&gt; element on page load.
    </p>
    <div class="tmpTrigger">
        <textarea id="" name="tmpExample" cols="50" rows="5">Example</textarea>
    </div>
    <p>
        Even triggering an event is made easier, you can use individual,
        event methods whith no arguments to do that too.
